# Easy Eats - Simple Recipe App

Concept site: Home cooking, easy and quick recipes.

## Project Scope

On the landing page, viewers can immediately see recipe cards. No need to dig through long-winded ad copy to locate the desired recipe. When the user clicks on one of the recipe cards, it takes them to a detailed component page, with all the ingredients and recipe details.

New recipes can be added easily with the 'new recipe' component. (Todo: add auth routes so only subscribed users can add recipes. Any site viewer can see the completed cards and details to make Easy Eats recipes, subscription req'd for adding new recipes.)

The new recipes component will also feature an easy way to add ingredients to the recipe card.

There will also be a search recipes component, a light and dark mode option and a colour theme picker for the site. Using the Context API and reducers to make this possible.

The initial recipe data will be saved in a db.json file, for seeding a database later in Firestore, scalable NoSQL cloud database. During the early development stage I'll use json-server for development and testing.

### `Pages + Routes`

Site pages folder structured to keep pages with multiple components per page all in one folder, along with their style sheets.

React-router-dom v6 installed and base routes set up and tested.

### `Navbar Component`

Navbar component scaffolding set up as a separate component as it will be used on each page. [TODO: Add Layout component].
